    <p>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program, we can:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied.</li>
        <li>Reduce the memory usage of the program and increase it's total run time.</li>
        <li>Reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms.</li>
    </ol>
